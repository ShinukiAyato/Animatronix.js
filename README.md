# Animatronix
  
This is the first discord.js bot I made and put a lot of effort in it. Please use the code as you want just dont take too much credit on it.
  
  
## Important:  
  
Make sure that the other information of the bot is change if you do copy the bot. It might not work if you don't put the necessary things to put in. There are a lot of things you need to change in there and a lot of important stuff at least. Make sure that you double check the codes before running it. There are some errors on the projects because of its unfinished work. This project is not yet complete so goodluck for those people who are gonna use it.
